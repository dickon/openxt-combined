Quick documentation
-------------------

Format of optional config file /etc/bootage.conf:

script NAME
dep DEPENDENCY...
start RUNLEVELS
stop RUNLEVELS (ignored)
block RUNLEVELS

For example:

script ssh
dep network autofs
start 2 3 4

Blank lines and lines STARTING with # are ignored

Any scripts found in the rcX.d directory but not mentioned, will
auto-depend on every script with a lower sequence number.

Scripts that have a dep line in the config file will not depend
on anything not explicitly specified there.

Dependencies that are not to be started will be ignored.

All scripts will be started as soon as their dependencies have
completed startup.

Scripts that are mentioned in bootage.conf but don't
exist in rcX.d will be run if the runlevel matches.

Scripts that are blocked will not be run in the listed
runlevels EXCEPT if a following "start" stanza explicitly
requests it (now whyever would you want to do that!?)

If a script is mentioned in rcX.d and the config file it
will be started regardless of any "start" directive.
