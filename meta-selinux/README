meta-selinux
============

This layer's purpose is enabling SE Linux support when used with Poky.

The majority of this layers work is accomplished in bbappend files, used to
enable SE Linux support in existing Poky packages.

A new recipes-security was added.  The purpose of this category is to add
software specific to system security.

Please see the MAINTAINERS file for information on contacting the maintainers

Building the meta-selinux layer
-------------------------------
In order to add selinux support to the poky build this layer should be added
to the bblayers.conf file.  In addition you should modify your local.conf
to specify the "poky-selinux" distribution.


An "oe-selinux" distribution is also included as a convienence for people
working with this layer, without the additional Poky meta data.  This
approach may work, but is not generally tested by the maintainers.
